kusasa-hs
=========

Kusasa is symbolic engine made for symbolically exploring the possible execution path of a program and concretely resuming the execution on a later stage.
For running you need the ghc Haskell compiler and a up-to-date browser.
Usage:
```bash
> ghci
Prelude> :l main.hs
*Main> main
```
While the server is running, Kusasa is available at ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html```.
